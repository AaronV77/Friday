Want to add / change:

- Implement the clear command for the system.
- Want to change all incoming characters to lowercase.

- Be able to read the shiftL, shiftR, ctrl, option, and tab.
    - I am able to read these keys but I don't know when for shift and ctrl
      are finished being pressed.  I need to figure out a way to be able to tell
      when the keys are done being pressed. This also goes for all characters
      that are created by using shift.

- Be able to read the caps, arrow keys when they are being pressed.
    - There is a problem being able to read these keys becasue there is nothing
      coming through the interrupt for the key. 

- Rework the structure in the boot folder.  - DONE (2/25/2019)
- Remove support for long mode. - DONE (2/25/2019)
- Update all comments. - DONE (2/26/2019)
- Fix the backspace component so that it updates the screen.
    - Should rename the append and backspace functions to truncate and concate 
      in the string library.  How I fixed this was by figuring out how the system
      was printing to the screen, printed a space rather than the dot the original
      designer put, and then adjusted the cursor back one more character. I also 
      had to put a bounds so that the user didn't delete the prompt and everything
      else off the screen. - DONE (2/26/2019)

- Add linking file to system.
    - I looked into creating a linking script for this project but would need
      to redo the make file so that all the assembly .o files were in the current
      directory as the linking script. I don't find this necessary right now for
      this to be done. (2/26/2019)
